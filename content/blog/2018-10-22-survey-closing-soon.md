# Last chance to take our survey on sustainable development of research software 

A major part of our year long effort to plan a US research software institute is to understand the diverse challenges and barriers that researchers face when using or developing research software.  To better understand these challenges, we are currently in the midst of running a large scale survey aimed at researchers who develop or use software in academia, government, and other research focused institutes. If you're involved in any aspect of research software or know colleagues who are, please take and share the survey:

It should take no more than 15-20 minutes to complete. The survey will close November 2, 2018.
