## When funding loss motivates innovation 

The County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) program has long provided data on U.S. population health indicators, supporting work in epidemiology, public policy, and community planning. With fifteen years of historical data to preserve and our current funding ending, we are motivated to innovate. This project aims to expand access to county-level health data by moving our work from SAS into R, publishing it on GitHub, developing a Shiny app to adapt parts of the hosted website, and creating an R package to make our data more widely accessible. In doing so, we hope to build a community of data scientists and public health professionals that can help make aspects of CHR&R self-sustaining, while also supporting ongoing efforts to secure new funding.

## What We’re Building

CHR&R’s strength has always been its documentation and usability, making complex public health data approachable for a wide range of users. As we move to a publicly accessible infrastructure, our goal is to preserve these strengths while embracing new opportunities to expand access, enhance reproducibility, and build a community of users. 

Our goals include the following: 

1. **R package**

We are developing an R package to make CHR&R data readily accessible in R with clear documentation and metadata. By lowering barriers to use, we aim to broaden the audience, support reproducible research, and encourage innovative applications of our data. 

2. **Shiny App**

We are building a Shiny app to replicate core aspects of the CHR&R website. Many of our users are small local health departments with limited data capacity, so usability is a priority. The app will provide interactive access to county-level health data.

3. **GitHub and Zenodo Archives**

To preserve CHR&R’s fifteen-year history, we are creating GitHub and Zenodo archives including data, documentation, and select calculations. In an era where data sources can be volatile, these documented archives are especially important. We aim to ensure that CHR&R’s history remains accessible and reproducible while laying the foundation for community engagement and long-term sustainability.

## Why It Matters

Preserving CHR&R data and making it more accessible helps researchers, public health professionals, and local communities understand and address health disparities. By lowering barriers to use and fostering a collaborative community, we aim to ensure that CHR&R resources can continue to inform policy and practice long into the future.
