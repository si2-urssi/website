### Project Overview


Funded by the Sloan Foundation, "Charting the Course: Policy and Planning for Sustainable Research Software" is a project aimed at reshaping the future of research software within the scholarly community through evidence-informed policy work. This initiative gathers and analyzes data about existing practices and policies, then communicates this crucial information to stakeholders. Building on established planning by [URSSI](/), the project strives to understand why research software policy changes succeed or fail, and leverages these insights to devise and refine future policy strategies for enhanced software sustainability and impact.

This policy work focuses on grasping and altering the sociotechnical landscape of research software to foster beneficial outcomes like software sustainability and improved research, rather than targeting changes at the individual or project level.

The project's work is being carried out in an open and transparent manner, with the aim of encouraging wider community engagement. All outcomes will be openly shared, supporting the on-going development of the sustainable software community.

### Our Approach


"Charting the Course: Policy and Planning for Sustainable Research Software" is a strategic initiative focused on understanding and transforming the sociotechnical landscape of research software for sustainable outcomes. Our goal is to drive policy changes that foster software sustainability and improved research.

Our policy work aims to grasp the nuances of the research software landscape and enact changes that lead to beneficial outcomes. Through evidence-based strategies, we're striving to improve software sustainability and impact in the research community.

This project is built upon the established planning of the [URSSI](https://urssi.us/about), furthering its vision for software sustainability and impact.
