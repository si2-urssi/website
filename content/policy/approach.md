"Charting the Course: Policy and Planning for Sustainable Research Software" is a strategic initiative focused on understanding and transforming the sociotechnical landscape of research software for sustainable outcomes. Our goal is to drive policy changes that foster software sustainability and improved research.

Our policy work aims to grasp the nuances of the research software landscape and enact changes that lead to beneficial outcomes. Through evidence-based strategies, we're striving to improve software sustainability and impact in the research community.
