## Data

Our data practices are rooted in principles of openness and transparency. We will share information about the data we collect, how it is analyzed, and how it informs our research process and outcomes.
We will also share our raw and processed data sets wherever possible, enabling others in the community to examine, reuse, and build upon our work. This aligns with our commitment to openness and our belief in the power of collective intelligence to drive change and innovation.
In all of this, we are mindful of ethical considerations, ensuring that all data is collected and used with consent and respect for privacy.
As our project progresses, more details about our data will be shared here. Check back regularly for updates on our data practices and findings.
