### First Software Sustainability Institute Workshop in Berkeley, CA (April 10-12)

Modern research is digital: data & publications are created, analyzed, and stored electronically using tools and methods expressed in software. Much software is developed specifically for research, by researchers. This research software essential to progress in almost all research fields, but it’s often not developed in an efficient or sustainable way, and knowledge is often locked away in individual laboratories or only shared via method papers that cannot directly be used by others. Researchers who develop software know their disciplines, but often don’t have training and understanding of best practices to ease development & maintainability and to encourage sustainability & reproducibility. And, developers don’t match the diversity of overall society or of user communities.

We have been funded by the NSF as “S2I2 Conceptualization: URSSI: Conceptualizing a US Research Software Sustainability Institute.” We proposed that the long-term goals of an institute should include:

- Help research software projects grow, become sustainable, and develop a governance model
- Establish developers with good practices
- Track software impact and usage, which are difficult to measure and interpret
- Help grantees of major funders communicate and share resources with each other
- Give the public a better understanding of science
- Bring more diversity into the field


In our conceptualization project, we want to:

- Conceptualize (plan) a US Research Software Sustainability Institute that goes beyond resources like GitHub
- Cut across existing activities funded by NSF and beyond
- Directly and indirectly positively impact all software development and maintenance projects across all of NSF
- Focus on the entire research software ecosystem, including the people who create, maintain, and use research software

Over the life of this project, we seek to create:

- An eager, supportive & inclusive community
- A concrete institute plan configured to offer valued services
- A published survey and data that demonstrates community need

We have planned a set of activities to achieve these outcomes, including 5 workshops (1 general, 3 focused, and 1 aimed to wrap up the work), a survey, a set of ethnographic studies, and a set of communication activities. This is our first workshop.

### Workshop 1

In this workshop, we want to:

Introduce URSSI
Help attendees meet each other and understand their goals Pilot some initial survey questions, and gather inputs about where it should be distributed Talk about the idea of ethnographic studies, and rather ideas on specific people and projects to study Present a set of topics that think will be important to further study, as areas of work in our future institute Identify a subset of these, plus additional topics that are potentially important to the community, to discuss further Refine, merge, discard topics Find who among the attendees might lead discussion on them Document the workshop’s results

We want to come out of this workshop with:

An informed and enthused set of attendees An improved survey, and a set of survey distribution mechanism Potential ethnographic study subjects An initial list of candidate topics for an institute, some of which may be well-understood A set of topics that should be further discussed in smaller follow-on workshops Initial thoughts on institute roles - what could the institute do to address the topics? Initial thoughts on institute organization - how could the institute be organized to do this?

####  Very Preliminary Agenda

The workshop will be 2 ½ days, starting the morning of day 1 (April 10), and ending at lunch on day 3 (April 12), with an additional ½ day for PIs to document and start planning the next activities. We will start with talks from NSF about institutes, talks about successful conceptualization project that led to institutes (SGCI and MolSSI) and a talk a from a recent conceptualization project in high-energy physics. The remainder of the workshop will include a mix of plenary (including lightning talks selected from the attendees), general topic breakouts (with similar questions asked of all attendees arranged in small groups), and unconference breakouts (with focused discussion around topics in self-selected groups)

**Open questions**

Tell us what you think. What have we missed? What else do you think we should do during the workshop to best achieve the goals? What do you not understand? What do you want to learn and/or take away from the workshop?

**Related Material**

If you would like to write a short position paper for this workshop and this overall project, please feel free to do so, and to self-publish it (via arxiv.org, figshare, zenodo, OSF, etc.), then send us (contact at urssi.us) a link to your paper, and we will post it on our website (http://urssi.us).

We will also be collecting links to related projects, papers, and reports on our website (http://urssi.us). Please feel free to send us (contact@urssi.us) any links that you think we should list, if possible, along with a few words about how each is related.
