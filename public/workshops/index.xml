      <description>Our fourth workshop is the second of URSSI&amp;rsquo;s topic focused community gatherings. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of experienced software funders, community managers, developers, researchers, and software users to share their experiences supporting and maintaining software incubator programs.
The meeting will feature lightning talks and discussions over two days. We hope to come away from the workshop with a clearer vision of how URSSI might either develop a new incubator program, or connect to and support existing incubators.</description>

      <description>Our third workshop is also the first of our topic focused community gatherings. Over two days in January 2019, 20 participants who are experts in various aspects of software citation and credit will gather in Santa Barbara to discuss how an institute can help researchers get credit for their software contributions and explore various other metrics that could help address the credit problem. The meeting will follow an unconference format and feature lightning talks and discussions over two days.</description>
